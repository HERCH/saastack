# How It Works

> This change log is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)

> All releases are documented in this file, in reverse order.

> We keep at least one `[Unreleased]` section that is to be used to capture changes as you work. When the release is ready, this section is versioned and moved down the file (past the horizontal break), AND a new `[Unreleased]` is created for the next release.
