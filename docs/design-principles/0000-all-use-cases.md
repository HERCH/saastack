A billing subscription is created for every `Organization` (personal and shared) on the platform (person and machine). It represents the billing subscription plan for that tenant/organization (i.e., pricing and cost). The subscription plan determines the `Features` each user has access to on the platform, and it defines the fiscal responsibilities that each `EndUser` has an obligation for (i.e., scheduled payments).

Every `Organization` must have a single `EndUser` that owns the fiscal responsibility of the `Organization`, and who can control the extent of that responsibility.
