# Tooling

Supporting tooling used to help you be more productive with this template, and code examples.

We make extensive use Roslyn Analyzers, Code Fixes and Source Generators to help you and your team be highly productive in following the established patterns this codebase.

For example, we make it trivial to define robust REST API's, and under the covers the tooling converts those API definitions into MediatR brokered minimal APIs for you. But you never have to write all that minimal API boiler plate stuff.

Furthermore, we have many Roslyn analyzers that continuously check your code to make sure that you and your team do not inadvertently violate certain architectural rules and constraints that are in place to manage the complexity of the source code over time, as your product develops. It is like having continuous code review, and your own plugins that understand your code.

For example, clean architecture mandates that all dependencies point inwards from Infrastructure to Application to Domain layers. But developers can easily violate that constraint by simply adding a using statement the other way. Your IDE doesn't care, and your code review process may miss that violation. Our Roslyn rules certainly wont miss that violation, and they will guide you to fix it.

Lastly, if you are using JetBrains Rider, we have baked in a set of common coding standards that are enforced across the codebase for you.
We also provide you with a number of project templates for adding the various projects for new subdomains.
We also give you several macros in the text editor (a.k.a Live Templates) for creating certain kinds of classes, like DDD ValueObjects and DDD AggregateRoots, and xUnit test classes.

You can see all of these things in the Platform/Tools projects.
