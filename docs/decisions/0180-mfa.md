# Context and Problem Statement

MFA is a difficult capability to add to any product. See the [OWASP MFA Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Multifactor_Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html) for considerations.

There are many options to support, and implementation is risky as there is a high chance to introduce unintended vulnerabilities into the product, or disclose secrets at rest, etc

Implementing MFA well is best left to the experts in general. However, due to the popularity of MFA, and given we have implemented credentials authentication already, we do need to decide how to implement MFA in our product.

Further, we need to consider how to make the transition easy if a consumer of SaaStack were to opt in to replace the
`Identity` subdomain with a third-party provider (such as: Auth0 or Okta or Identity Server, etc).

## Considered Options

The options are:

1. Emulate Auth0's API, with partial support

2. Adapt a common framework or library

> In any case, follow the implementation guidance at OWASP

## Decision Outcome

`Auth0 Lookalike`

- Limit the number of library/framework dependencies in the platform
- High confidence in having a secure enough implementation
- Auth0 API are well documented, even though we don't have a fully compliant )Auth2 Identity subdomain (see: [0100-authentication](0100-authentication.md))
- Our API endpoints mirror Auth0 endpoints close enough.

## (Optional) More Information

Auth0 API is well documented:

* [API Explorer for MFA](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#multi-factor-authentication)
* [Custom MFA  flows](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/authenticate-using-ropg-flow-with-mfa/enroll-challenge-sms-voice-authenticators) (for credentials)
